The game was decompiled from the Visual Basic 5 source via VB Decompiler. It all seems to load fine in VB6 Studio and I can edit and redesign the forms. However, I'm currently getting memory errors when I try to build and compile to .exe on Windows 10.

Translated strings are located in the `translation.csv` file. Translated source files are in the `en` directory.
